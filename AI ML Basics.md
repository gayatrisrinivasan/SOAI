### Supervised Learning:
- **Definition:** Training a model on labeled data for predictions/decisions.
- **Example:** Recognizing a dog from labeled images.
- **Applications:** Fraud detection, speech recognition, medical diagnosis.
- **Popular Algorithms:**
    - Linear Regression: Predict y from x (y = mx + c).
    - Logistic Regression: Binary classification.
    - Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Case Studies:**
    - Predictive Maintenance
    - Fraud Detection
    - Language Translation
- **Advantages:** Accurate, handles complex tasks.
- **Limitations:** Potential bias, depends on labeled data.

---

### Unsupervised Learning:
- **Definition:** Learning patterns without labeled data.
- **Example:** Google Photos clustering faces.
- **Applications:**
    - Customer Segmentation
    - Dimensionality Reduction
- **Popular Algorithms:**
    - K-means Clustering
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Real-world Examples:**
    - Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Amazon.
- **Applications:**
    - Personalized recommendations
    - Improved customer targeting
